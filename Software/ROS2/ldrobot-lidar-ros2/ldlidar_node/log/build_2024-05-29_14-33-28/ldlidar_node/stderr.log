[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:92 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findldlidar_component.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ldlidar_component", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ldlidar_component"
  with any of the following names:

    ldlidar_componentConfig.cmake
    ldlidar_component-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ldlidar_component" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ldlidar_component_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
  files.  If "ldlidar_component" provides a separate development package or
  SDK, be sure it has been installed.
